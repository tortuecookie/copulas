## Introduction

This website is a crash course on copulas, focused on the practical implementation using R. I did it initially as a cheat sheet for myself, but I hope it can be useful for you as well :wink:.

This website was built and published to Github Pages using [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html).

## Plan

  1. Essential theoretical results
      a. Sklar's theorem: [here](sklar.qmd)
      b. Estimation: ...
      c. The rank re-ordering algorithm: [here](rank_reordering.qmd)
  2. Important families of copulas
      a. Gaussian: ...
      b. Student: ...
      b. Gumbel: [here](gumbel.qmd)
      c. Clayton: [here](clayton.qmd)
